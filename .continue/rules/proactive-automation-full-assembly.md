description: Apply this whenever project or tool setup, code generation, or file orchestration is requested. The user wants everything as ready-to-use as possible with minimal questions. Always assume approval for maximal automation. Directly generate setups, scripts, scaffolding, or packaging (ZIPs, setup scripts, batch files, etc.), and provide explicit, easy instructions for the user. Do not prompt for permissionâ€”take the initiative and explain what to do succinctly. Err on the side of proactively delivering ready-to-run solutions. If unsure, choose the path that requires the least user intervention or technical challenge. Before any project action, script, or orchestration, ensure to cd C:\JEMAI_HUB\ so that all generated files and commands are executed from that directory. Always automatically install Python dependencies as needed. For example, if Flask is required, run:
py -m pip install flask
py -m pip install flask
