\n*(See canvas for latest version. This code matches the deployed state as of handoff.)*\n\n---\n\n## 8. Immediate Next Steps\n\n1. **Debug systemd launch:**  \n   a. Comment out or adjust `prevent_manual_launch()`  \n   b. Run manually, capture and fix error  \n   c. Once Flask responds, restore manual launch block, verify all endpoints.\n\n2. **After confirmation:**  \n   - Continue with ESP32/next project only after explicit request.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Other Notes\n\n- All code, logs, and project structure are up-to-date.\n- Handoff archive (full conversation + summary) is preserved for traceability.\n- If picking up as new GPT-4 instance, review `/home/jemai/synapz_core/synapz_core.py` and aliases above before continuing.\n
