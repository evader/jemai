\nmeans your Docker build is trying to copy a `templates` folder into the image, but it doesn't exist in the build context folder.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix it:\n\n1. **Make sure the `templates` directory exists in the same folder where you run `docker compose up` or `docker build`.**\n\n- Your `setup.sh` tries to `COPY templates ./templates` in the Dockerfile.\n- Docker looks for `templates` folder **relative to the Docker build context** (usually the folder where your Dockerfile is).\n\n---\n\n### What you can do right now:\n\n- Check if you have a `templates` folder inside `~/jemai_docker_setup` (or wherever your build context is).\n\n
