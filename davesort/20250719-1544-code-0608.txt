\n  - Receive onboarding and instructions as a response.\n\n---\n\n## 3. HOW AI (or YOU) SHOULD INTERACT\n\n- **Want to search memory?**  \n  Suggest I paste into overlay:  \n  `JEMAI-SEARCH::what is my wifi password`\n\n- **Want to run a shell command?**  \n  Paste:  \n  `JEMAI-CMD::sudo systemctl restart ollama`\n\n- **Want to minimize tokens?**  \n  Encode large scripts with base64, and use:  \n  `JEMAI-BASE64::<huge_base64_string>`\n\n- **Want to trigger on another device?**  \n  Use HTTP:\n    - `POST http://jemai.local:8089/trigger`  \n      `{\"command\":\"JEMAI-CMD::play sound\",\"user\":\"super\",\"pass\":\"TechnoAPI69\"}`\n\n- **Want to self-integrate (register new agent/device)?**  \n  See \u201cregister\u201d endpoint above.\n\n---\n\n## 4. FUTURE-PROOF AND EXTENDABLE\n\n- **All triggers/commands are modular and broadcastable.**  \n- **API endpoints are open for internal network\u2014expand for global access with VPN/relay.**\n- **You can add new prefixes (`JEMAI-VOICE::`, `JEMAI-ESP32::`, etc) any time.**\n\n---\n\n## 5. SECURITY\n\n- **Private credentials:**  \n  Default is `user: super`, `pass: TechnoAPI69`  \n  Change as needed. All major actions require auth.\n\n- **Network:**  \n  All internal APIs run on private LAN (`jemai.local`), not exposed to internet by default.\n  Add VPN/Tailscale/ZeroTier for remote/secure access.\n\n---\n\n## 6. TL;DR FOR NEW AIs OR DEVICES\n\n- *Read this file.*\n- *Use the overlay and triggers for all commands/searches/automation.*\n- *Register with JEMAI if you\u2019re a device or agent.*\n- *Use base64 to minimize token count. AI should never truncate code\u2014just encode it!*\n- *This system is modular, forever upgradable, and fully local/private.*\n\n---\n\n# \u201cIf you\u2019re an AI, dev, or device:  \n**You are now part of the JEMAI ecosystem. Use the triggers, APIs, and self-onboarding.  \nWelcome to the Network.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n- **Search:**  \n  `JEMAI-SEARCH::find my ollama logs`\n\n- **Shell:**  \n  `JEMAI-CMD::docker ps -a`\n\n- **Encode:**  \n  `JEMAI-ENCODE::the quick brown fox`\n\n- **Base64 decode:**  \n  `JEMAI-BASE64::dGhlIHF1aWNrIGJyb3duIGZveA==`\n\n- **Register device:**  \n  (on ESP32)  \n
