This is a complex, multi-faceted project requiring expertise in system setup, AI toolchains, and hardware integration. The core challenge will be managing pre-downloaded dependencies for an offline environment. I need to outline a high-level strategy incorporating initial online preparation and subsequent offline installation, emphasizing hardware requirements and storage.\n\n**Planning Phase 0: High-Level Overview**\n\nI will begin by outlining the core principles for an offline setup, stressing the importance of an initial online preparation phase for downloading all components. I will include hardware recommendations, particularly focusing on GPU requirements given AI workloads are compute-intensive. A structured directory for downloads is essential. This initial response will set the stage for detailed instructions in subsequent prompts.\n\n",
