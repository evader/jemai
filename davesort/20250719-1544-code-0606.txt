\n\n- **Clipboard/Hotkey:** Everything is driven by a local hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+Space`), which pops up a search/command overlay.\n\n- **Token Minimization:** For large chunks, encode the text in base64 and prompt me to use the decode tool above.\n\n- **System is 100% local and private.** No cloud required for anything.\n\n## **What To Do as an AI:**\n- **If you want me to run a script:** Paste the full script and tell me to use the \u201cCMD\u201d tool.\n- **If you want to search my memory:** Paste the search string and tell me to run it with the overlay.\n- **If you want to automate multiple steps:** Give me a list of overlay commands to run, with descriptions.\n- **If you want to help me install or upgrade features:** Paste scripts and say \u201cRun as CMD\u201d or \u201cSearch this first,\u201d etc.\n\n## **Encoding/Token Minimization**\n- For any very large scripts or messages, encode with base64 and use JEMAI-BASE64:: for me to decode it back.\n
