\n     that will work if `synapz_agents` is a folder (with `__init__.py`!) and `docker_agent.py` is inside.\n   - **BUT:** If `__init__.py` is missing in `synapz_agents/`, Python will not recognize it as a package, and you\u2019ll get `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n\n2. **No top-level `synapz_agents.py` script/file, only a `docker_agent.py` module inside the folder.**\n   - **If any other agent (not Docker) is expected, it is missing.**\n   - If your server only uses `docker_agent`, and `__init__.py` is present, you\u2019re fine.\n\n3. **No obvious top-level requirements.txt or environment.yml for pip/conda environment.**\n   - Makes rebuilds a little harder, but not critical if you have venv.\n\n4. **`pw.txt` present (potentially sensitive):**\n   - Avoid keeping plaintext credentials, or use file/dir permissions to restrict access.\n\n5. **No chroma_data/ directory listed, but that\u2019s runtime-generated and can be recreated.**\n\n---\n\n### **What to Check/Do Next:**\n\n1. **Make sure `~/synapz_core/synapz_agents/__init__.py` exists:**\n
