That\u2019s exactly what we want to see!\n\n---\n\n### **What this means:**\n- The Flask server *is* running.\n- Your systemd service is working (otherwise `/chat` wouldn\u2019t reply).\n- Curl POSTs work instantly.\n- Synapz Core is \u201cgood to go.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **But**  \nYou *still* saw relay timeouts, right?  \nThat means your relay script is trying to hit `/chat` but sometimes can\u2019t connect (or connects, but times out).\n\n---\n\n## **Let\u2019s fix the relay timing for good**\nThe relay script uses a **3 second** loop but the timeout is 10 seconds. If the endpoint is a little slow or restarting, you can get those timeouts, but it *should* recover on next try.\n\nBut if it\u2019s still *always* timing out, even when curl works, something\u2019s weird with the request handling or your server isn\u2019t fully ready when the relay hits.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Next Steps**\n\n1. **Kill the relay script if it\u2019s still running.**\n   - Just `Ctrl+C` in that terminal.\n\n2. **Make sure the Flask API is running and stable.**\n   - Run `curl http://localhost:11436/status` a few times in a row, make sure it\u2019s always fast and returns instantly.\n\n3. **Restart the relay script:**\n
