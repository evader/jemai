\n\nThis forces the embedding model to load on CPU, avoiding the missing GPU error.\n\n---\n\n#### Option 2: Fix GPU support (more complex)\n\n- Confirm you have an NVIDIA GPU physically installed  \n- Check that NVIDIA drivers are installed and working on your host  \n- Ensure Docker is running with NVIDIA Container Toolkit configured correctly  \n- Confirm your containers have access to the GPU (with `--gpus all` or Docker Compose device reservation)  \n- Restart Docker daemon and containers  \n\n---\n\n### Next immediate step:\n\n1. Edit `jemai_core.py` to use `'cpu'` as above (just replace that line)  \n2. Rebuild docker image:\n\n
