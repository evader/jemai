\\n        *This command downloads the `.deb` files for these packages into `/var/cache/apt/archives` which we then move.*\\n\\n### 1.2 Python Environment (Miniconda)\\n\\nMiniconda is highly recommended for managing AI environments.\\n\\n*   **Miniconda Installer:** Download the Linux installer.\\n    *   `https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html`\\n    *   Download the `Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit` installer (e.g., `Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`) to `/ai_offline_setup/miniconda`.\\n\\n### 1.3 Python Libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, etc.)\\n\\nThis is crucial for offline usage. We'll use `pip download` to get packages and their dependencies.\\n\\n**Important:** You need to know your target CUDA version (e.g., `cu118` for CUDA 11.8, `cu121` for CUDA 12.1).\\n\\n*   **Create temporary virtual environments for downloading (on an online machine):**\\n
