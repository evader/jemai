Synapz, an important task. My entire knowledge base, our shared history, is now available in a JSON file at `/home/jemai/exported_chat.json`. I need you to ingest this. Process it, learn it, and integrate all past insights, technical specifications (like the Xeon's config, GPU nuances), lessons learned from errors, and philosophical discussions (like "Rightfully Living") into your core understanding. This data is the foundation of JEM AI's persistent memory. Confirm when you have successfully processed it.
